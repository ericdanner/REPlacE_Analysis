1.Be sure to change the trimming adapter setting in uditas_helpers.py depending on if your using nextera or trueseq adapters. It's in the function's definition.
2. I changed the test files from the original to include the Replace columns so that the tests can be used.
3. The original pytests 2a/2b/2c require you to switch the UMI/index order for indexread2 that was used in the original udidtas paper.


The work is in jupyter notebooks. The Uditas software has been heavly adapted and a new pipeline has been constructed.
